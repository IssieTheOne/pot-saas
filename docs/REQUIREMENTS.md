## Design Decisions & Recommendations

### Car Dealership Template Strategy

**Recommendation: Create Dedicated Car Dealership Template**

**Rationale:**
- Car dealerships have highly specialized needs that differ significantly from general retail
- Vehicle inventory requires VIN tracking, history reports, and market data integration
- Financing applications and trade-in valuations are unique to automotive sales
- Service scheduling and warranty management are dealership-specific
- Market data integration for vehicle pricing is critical for dealership operations

**Template Features:**
- **Vehicle Inventory**: VIN tracking, condition reports, market data integration
- **Financing Management**: Loan applications, approval tracking, lender integration
- **Trade-in Valuation**: Automated valuation tools with market data
- **Service Department**: Appointment scheduling, service history, warranty tracking
- **Sales Pipeline**: Lead management, deal progression, commission tracking
- **Market Integration**: Real-time vehicle pricing, auction data, market trends

**Business Justification:**
- Car dealerships represent a lucrative market segment
- High willingness to pay for specialized software
- Clear differentiation from generic retail solutions
- Potential for premium pricing due to specialized features

### Notifications System Architecture

- **No Full Messaging System**: Focus on structured notifications rather than free-form messaging
- **Notification Types**:
  - System announcements (maintenance, updates)
  - Admin broadcasts (policy changes, important updates)

  - Task assignments and updates
  - Approval requests and responses

**Technical Implementation:**

### Online Status Implementation

**Features:**
- Real-time presence indicators (online/offline/away/busy)
- Last seen timestamps for offline users
- Privacy controls for status visibility
- Team availability dashboard
- Automated status updates based on activity

**Technical Approach:**
