## �🚀 Quick Start

### 🌐 **Try Live Demo**
Visit the [live deployment](https://pot-saas-56nj4yzio-issies-projects-7a16c2ac.vercel.app) to explore the platform immediately!

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pot-saas
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### 3. Supabase Setup
1. Create account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create new project
3. Copy URL and API keys to `.env.local`
4. **Choose your database setup option below:**

#### Option A: Fresh Database (Recommended for new projects)
If you have a **new/empty Supabase project**, run this script:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of docs/fresh-database-setup.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and execute
```
This will create all tables, policies, and seed data from scratch.

#### Option B: Migrate Existing Database
If you have an **existing Supabase project** with some tables already created:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of docs/database-migration.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and execute
```
This will add missing columns/tables without deleting existing data.

**Handles these scenarios:**
- ✅ Tables that exist but need new columns
- ✅ Tables that don't exist yet (creates them)
- ✅ Existing policies (drops and recreates safely)
- ✅ Missing indexes and triggers
- ✅ Conditional operations to avoid errors
- ✅ **Fixed**: Policy creation syntax errors

#### Option C: Manual Schema Review
Review the complete schema in `docs/enhanced-database-schema.sql` and run individual statements as needed.

### 4. Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude API
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Email**: SendGrid/AWS SES

## � Troubleshooting

### Database Issues

**Error: "syntax error at or near 'NOT'" (policy creation)**
- **Solution**: The migration script has been updated to handle policy creation properly
- The script now uses DO blocks to check for existing policies before creating new ones
- Run the updated `docs/database-migration.sql` which handles this automatically

**Error: "relation 'features' does not exist"**
- **Solution**: The migration script has been updated with conditional operations for all feature-related components
- Policy drops are now conditional (only attempt to drop policies for existing tables)
- Feature-related tables, indexes, policies, and functions are created conditionally only after the features table exists
- The script uses DO blocks with `information_schema.tables` checks to ensure safe operations
- Run the updated `docs/database-migration.sql` which handles all feature dependencies correctly

**Error: "relation already exists"**
- **Solution**: Use the migration script instead of the full schema
- Run `docs/database-migration.sql` for existing databases

**Error: "policy already exists"**
- **Solution**: The migration script drops existing policies before recreating them
- Use `docs/database-migration.sql` for existing databases

**Need to start fresh (delete all data)**
- **Solution**: Use `docs/fresh-database-setup.sql`
- ⚠️ **WARNING**: This deletes all existing data

**Missing features after migration**
- **Solution**: Check that all tables were created successfully
- Review the migration output for any errors

### Common Development Issues

**Build fails with TypeScript errors**
```bash
npm run build
# Check for type errors and fix them
```

**Supabase connection issues**
- Verify `.env.local` has correct credentials
- Check Supabase project is active
- Ensure RLS policies are properly configured

**File upload issues**
- Configure Cloudflare R2 bucket
- Set proper CORS policies
- Check file size limits (100MB default)
